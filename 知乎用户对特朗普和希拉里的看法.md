知乎用户对特朗普和希拉里的看法—— 基于爬虫和文本挖掘技术的分析
================

GitHub Documents
----------------

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist    
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
